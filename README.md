Not a whole lot to say here. pretty standard, punch the stuff in according to the prompt. don't overthink it, doing so will probably break the duct tape and glue holding it together. made this in about 2 hours because i was bored as shit, and i needed to understand maclaurin series

features include: 

a few easter eggs
caesar cipher encoding that changes the shift key with each letter
converting that caesar cipher into a maclaurin series of e, with the x value being represented by the value of the shift key

it's not complex, it's not effective, but it more or less works. made entirely by hand in java.
